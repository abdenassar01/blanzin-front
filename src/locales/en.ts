This approach combines theoretical knowledge with substantial practical experience and typically lasts between two and three and a half years. Each week, you spend one or two days, or longer blocks, in vocational school, where instructors provide you with the theoretical foundations of your field. On the remaining days, you work in a company, applying this knowledge in practice, for example, by working on machines. You also gain insight into how the company operates and its functions, helping you determine if you can envision a future career there.',
